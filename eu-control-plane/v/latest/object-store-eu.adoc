how and what rest api's to use for remove assignment of usecase in apim

= In Azure API Management (APIM), if you want to remove an assigned use case (e.g., remove an API from a product, delete a policy, or unassign a user/group), you will typically use the Azure REST API.

= Possible Use Cases & API Endpoints
Here are some common scenarios where you may need to remove an assignment:

Use Case	REST API Endpoint	Method

=Remove an API from a product	DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/products/{productId}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01	DELETE

=Delete an API policy	DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}/policies/policy?api-version=2022-08-01	DELETE

=Remove a user from a group	DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/groups/{groupId}/users/{userId}?api-version=2022-08-01	DELETE

=Unassign an API operation	DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2022-08-01	DELETE

how and what rest api's to use for decommission of usecase in apim

Decommissioning a Use Case in Azure API Management (APIM) Using REST APIs
To decommission a use case in APIM, you typically need to remove or disable related resources like APIs, products, subscriptions, policies, and users. Below are the relevant REST API calls to achieve this.

Steps to Decommission a Use Case in APIM
= 1. Disable API (Optional)
Before deletion, you can disable an API to prevent usage. This can be done by updating the API with subscriptionRequired set to false.
Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01
Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "properties": {
    "subscriptionRequired": false,
    "isCurrent": false
  }
}

= 2. Remove API from Products
Each API is linked to a product. You need to remove the API from all assigned products. Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/products/{productId}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01

= 3. Delete API Policies (Optional)
If your API has policies, remove them to ensure no traces of them remain.
Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}/policies/policy?api-version=2022-08-01

= 4. Remove API Operations
Each API has operations (endpoints). Delete them before removing the API itself.
Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2022-08-01

= 5. Remove API Subscriptions
Users may have active subscriptions to an API. You should delete those before removing the API. Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}?api-version=2022-08-01

= 6. Delete the API
Once all dependencies are removed, delete the API itself.
Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01

= 7. Remove Users from Groups (Optional)
If the use case is user-specific, remove users from APIM groups. Endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/groups/{groupId}/users/{userId}?api-version=2022-08-01


= Automation: Using cURL
You can execute these requests using cURL. Hereâ€™s an example for deleting an API:

sh
Copy
Edit
curl -X DELETE "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"


= Final Verification
Check Azure Portal under APIM > APIs to confirm the API is removed.
Run a GET API request to verify the API is deleted:
http
Copy
Edit
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2022-08-01
If the API is successfully decommissioned, this request should return a 404 Not Found.
