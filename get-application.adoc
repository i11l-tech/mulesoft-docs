 ==  Manager Commentscompanies
-Santosh has delivered multiple features this year. Because of the technology change, Santosh has experienced some learning curve in the first couple months when he started working on the glossary API. After the learning period, he has demonstrated good velocity in delivering new features.
As a VP level engineer, Santosh should more proactively drive the feature design and implementation. For every new feature, Santosh should spend sometime time thinking how this feature fits into the whole product and how this feature should be designed.

--Santosh collaborated within and outside the team well. He is willing to help other team members when they request help. However, I'd like to see Santosh take a more proactive position, and really drive the conversation and technical decisions.

-2020 has been a lot of change in working tools & technologies. I have successfully adapted to change in environments. Built a host of useful API's collaborating with the team. I will continue to add more value by going more in depth in data governance domain and also in the required technologies. Also work on improving leadership and collaboration skills.

=Manager Comments

-Santosh has adjusted to new team and technology well in the past year. He picked up Java quickly and delivered multiple features afterwards. He definitely put a lot of effort for this adjustment, especially during the global pandemic period.
In the new year, I am looking forward for Santosh continue growing the technical depth, holding the engineering practice bar for more junior engineers, and working on the technical leadership skills.
