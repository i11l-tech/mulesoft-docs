= how to assign 'provision tru put' to model of product in apim using rest api

In Azure API Management (APIM), "Provision Throughput" (PTU) is typically related to the rate-limiting and quota policies applied to a product or API, rather than a specific "model." If you're asking how to assign throughput or quota limits to an API or product, you would need to configure policies related to these settings (such as `quota`, `rate-limit`, or `throughput`), either on the API level or the product level.

### Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to assign throughput settings to an API or product using the APIM REST API:

### 1. **Set Up the Product Quota/Throughput Policy (if you're referring to the "quota" policy):**
You can define throughput or quota settings on a product or an API by setting a policy for rate limiting, quota, or throughput.

#### **a. Apply Quota/Throughput Policy to a Product or API:**
First, you need to apply the throughput (quota or rate-limiting) policy via the `product` or `api` level.

Here’s how to define a quota policy via the **APIM REST API**:

### 2. **Get the Product ID:**
You first need to identify the product you want to apply throughput settings to.

```http
GET https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/products?api-version=2021-08-01
```
This request will give you the list of products in your APIM, and you can find the `productId` you wish to update.

### 3. **Define the Throughput (Quota) Policy:**
Once you have the `productId`, you can apply the throughput settings by updating the product’s policy. For example, to apply a **quota** policy, you can define the maximum number of calls a user can make in a certain time window.

#### Example: Apply Quota policy to a Product

```http
PATCH https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/policies?api-version=2021-08-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "properties": {
    "policyContent": "<inbound><rate-limit calls=\"1000\" renewal-period=\"3600\" /> </inbound>"
  }
}
```

#### Example Quota Policy Explanation:
- **`calls="1000"`**: Allows 1000 requests in a renewal period.
- **`renewal-period="3600"`**: The time window (in seconds) for the quota to reset (here it’s 3600 seconds, or 1 hour).
- The `<inbound>` tag defines an inbound policy for the product/API.

### 4. **Apply Throughput (Rate Limit) Policy:**
Similarly, you can apply a **rate-limit** policy, which is more about controlling the rate of requests.

#### Example: Apply Rate Limit policy:

```http
PATCH https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/policies?api-version=2021-08-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "properties": {
    "policyContent": "<inbound><rate-limit calls=\"500\" renewal-period=\"60\" /> </inbound>"
  }
}
```

- **`calls="500"`**: Limits to 500 requests per renewal period.
- **`renewal-period="60"`**: A time window of 60 seconds.

### 5. **Assign the Policy to a Product or API:**
Once the policy content is set, assign the policy to your **product** or **API** using the PATCH or PUT API:

#### Assign Policy to API or Product:

For product-level policy:
```http
PATCH https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/products/{productId}/policies?api-version=2021-08-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "properties": {
    "policyContent": "<inbound><rate-limit calls=\"1000\" renewal-period=\"3600\" /> </inbound>"
  }
}
```

For API-level policy:
```http
PATCH https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/apis/{apiId}/policies?api-version=2021-08-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "properties": {
    "policyContent": "<inbound><rate-limit calls=\"500\" renewal-period=\"60\" /> </inbound>"
  }
}
```

### 6. **Verify the Policy:**
After applying the policy, you can verify whether it has been successfully applied to the product or API by checking the product details.

```http
GET https://{apim-name}.azure-api.net/products/{productId}?api-version=2021-08-01
```

### Recap:
- The concept of "Provision Throughput" (PTU) often refers to **rate-limiting** or **quota** policies in APIM.
- You can assign throughput by setting **quota** or **rate-limit** policies to a product or API.
- The `PATCH` or `PUT` method is used to apply these policies to your product or API.

### Key Terms:
- **Quota**: The maximum number of calls allowed over a specific time period.
- **Rate-limit**: Controls the rate of requests that can be made within a time window.
