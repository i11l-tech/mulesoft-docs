To create new products and map updates in **Azure API Management (APIM)**, you will need to interact with the **Azure API Management REST API**. This allows you to manage APIs, products, subscriptions, and other elements of your API Management service.

### 1. **Create a New Product**
To create a new product in **Azure API Management**, you would use the **`Create a product`** operation.

#### API Endpoint:
```
POST https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/products?api-version=2021-08-01
```

#### Request Body Example (for creating a product):
```json
{
  "displayName": "New Product",
  "description": "This is a new product for managing APIs",
  "terms": "Terms and conditions for using this product",
  "subscriptionRequired": true,
  "approvalRequired": false,
  "state": "published"
}
```

**Important Fields:**
- `displayName`: The name of the product displayed to users.
- `description`: A brief description of the product.
- `terms`: Terms and conditions (if applicable).
- `subscriptionRequired`: Boolean indicating if a subscription is required to access the product.
- `approvalRequired`: Boolean indicating whether approval is required for subscription to the product.
- `state`: The product state, such as `published` or `draft`.

### 2. **Update Product Details (Mapping Updates)**
To update a product's details, you would use the **`Update a product`** operation.

#### API Endpoint:
```
PUT https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/products/{product-id}?api-version=2021-08-01
```

#### Request Body Example (for updating a product):
```json
{
  "displayName": "Updated Product Name",
  "description": "Updated description for the product",
  "terms": "Updated terms and conditions",
  "subscriptionRequired": false,
  "approvalRequired": true,
  "state": "published"
}
```

Here, you can update any of the fields that you want to change, such as the `displayName`, `description`, `terms`, `subscriptionRequired`, etc.

### 3. **Mapping Updates to APIs**
To map an API to the product, you can use the **`Add API to product`** operation.

#### API Endpoint:
```
POST https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/products/{product-id}/apis?api-version=2021-08-01
```

#### Request Body Example (for mapping an API to a product):
```json
{
  "apiId": "<api-id>"
}
```

Where:
- `apiId`: The identifier of the API you want to associate with the product.

### 4. **Manage Subscription to Products**
If you need to create or manage subscriptions to a product, use the **`Create a subscription`** operation.

#### API Endpoint:
```
POST https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/subscriptions?api-version=2021-08-01
```

#### Request Body Example (for creating a subscription):
```json
{
  "userId": "<user-id>",
  "productId": "<product-id>",
  "state": "active",
  "displayName": "User Subscription to Product"
}
```

Where:
- `userId`: The user ID to associate the subscription with.
- `productId`: The product ID the subscription is for.
- `state`: The state of the subscription, e.g., `active` or `inactive`.
- `displayName`: A friendly name for the subscription.

### 5. **Example of Complete Process**
To summarize, here's how the entire process might look in API calls:
1. **Create a Product:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /products`
2. **Update Product Details (Mapping Updates):**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /products/{product-id}`
3. **Map APIs to Product:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /products/{product-id}/apis`
4. **Create Subscription to Product:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /subscriptions`

### Authentication
To authenticate these requests, you need to use an **Azure Active Directory (AAD) token** or a **subscription key**. Typically, an AAD token is recommended, and you can obtain it by authenticating against Azure using OAuth 2.0.

You can generate the **API Management service access token** from Azure Active Directory.

### Example Using Azure CLI:
To authenticate using Azure CLI:
```bash
az account get-access-token --resource https://management.azure.com
```

You can then use the token in the `Authorization` header for your API calls:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```
