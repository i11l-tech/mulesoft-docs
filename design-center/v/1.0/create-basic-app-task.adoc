= how and what rest api's to use for increasing provision thru put quota for a openai instance usecase in apim


To increase the **provisioned throughput quota** for an **OpenAI instance** in **Azure API Management (APIM)**, you'll primarily be interacting with **Azure OpenAI Service** quotas and limits, which are tied to the **Azure API Management (APIM)** service. While there isn't a specific API to directly increase **throughput quota** for OpenAI, you can work with two aspects:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service limits**
2. **Azure API Management (APIM) service configurations**

Let’s go step-by-step on how you can manage and increase these quotas.

### 1. **Managing OpenAI Quota via Azure Management API**

Azure OpenAI API uses certain quota and rate limits depending on your subscription, service tier, and the specific resource.

To manage quotas related to **Azure OpenAI**, you need to:

#### Check your current OpenAI quota:
Before increasing, you may want to confirm your current OpenAI resource quota and limits. Use the **Azure OpenAI Service** API to retrieve quota and usage data.

**API endpoint**:  
- **List Usage and Quotas**:  
  ```
  GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/usage?api-version=2021-10-01
  ```

This API gives you information about your current usage limits and quotas, which includes things like throughput and rate limits. Based on that, you can assess if you need to increase your throughput.

#### Increase OpenAI Throughput Quota (if applicable):

If you're on a restricted tier, you'll need to **request an increase** to your OpenAI quota through **Azure Support**. There isn't a direct API for modifying OpenAI throughput quotas. You can go through the Azure portal to request an increase, or alternatively:

- **Azure Support request**: You can submit a support ticket to increase your throughput quota in **Azure** by contacting **Azure support**:
  - Go to **Azure Portal** → **Help + Support** → **New Support Request** → **Quota increase**.

You will need to select **Azure OpenAI** and provide details about your desired throughput increase.

### 2. **Managing Throughput in Azure API Management (APIM)**

Azure API Management (APIM) controls the **throughput** at the API level. If you're managing the OpenAI instance through **APIM**, you can control rate limits, quotas, and throughput for APIs using the **Azure API Management policies**.

#### Set API Quotas in APIM:

In Azure API Management, you can set rate limits and quotas for an API (including OpenAI integration).

- Use the **Azure REST API** or the **Azure Portal** to configure these policies.

**API Endpoint to update API policies**:
```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apimServiceName}/apis/{apiId}/policy?api-version=2021-08-01
```

**Sample Policy** for setting **rate limits** and **quotas**:
```xml
<inbound>
    <!-- Rate limit the API to 1000 calls per minute -->
    <rate-limit calls="1000" renewal-period="60" />
    <!-- Set quota to 5000 calls per day -->
    <quota calls="5000" period="day" />
</inbound>
<outbound>
    <!-- Optional outbound policies (if required) -->
</outbound>
<on-error>
    <!-- Optional error handling policies -->
</on-error>
```

In this case, you can increase the **calls** parameter in the **rate-limit** and **quota** policies depending on your required throughput.

#### Increase APIM Capacity:

If you're hitting throughput limits in **API Management**, you may need to scale your APIM instance to a higher tier, like **Premium** or **Standard**.

**API Endpoint to scale the APIM instance**:
```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}?api-version=2021-08-01
```

**Payload to update capacity**:
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "sku": {
      "name": "Premium",  // Or another tier like Standard or Developer
      "capacity": 2  // The desired capacity, depending on how much throughput you need
    }
  }
}
```

- **Capacity**: This defines the number of **scale units**. Increasing the scale units can handle a larger number of requests per second.

### 3. **Azure CLI or PowerShell**:

You can also use **Azure CLI** or **PowerShell** to scale your **APIM instance** and update quotas:

**Azure CLI**:  
To update your **APIM tier**:
```bash
az apim update --name {apimServiceName} --resource-group {resourceGroup} --sku Premium --capacity 2
```

**PowerShell**:
```powershell
Set-AzApiManagement -ResourceGroupName {resourceGroup} -Name {apimServiceName} -Sku Premium -Capacity 2
```

### Summary:

To increase the **provisioned throughput quota** for an **OpenAI instance** in Azure API Management:
1. **Check your OpenAI quota** using the **Azure OpenAI API** and contact Azure Support if needed.
2. If you're hitting limits in **APIM**, use **API Management policies** to adjust quotas and rate limits.
3. **Scale the APIM instance** to a higher tier (e.g., Premium) if you need more throughput.
4. You may need to **request an increase** via **Azure Support** if you're on a restricted tier for **OpenAI**.
