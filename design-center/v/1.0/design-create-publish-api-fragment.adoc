= how and what rest api’s to use for deletion of models  in apim



In Azure API Management (APIM), the term "models" isn't explicitly defined as a distinct resource. However, if you're referring to APIs, products, or other components within APIM, here's how you can delete them using REST APIs:

**1. Deleting an API:**

To delete a specific API from your APIM instance, use the following REST API:

```

DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/apis/{apiId}?api-version=2024-05-01
```


Replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{serviceName}`, and `{apiId}` with your subscription ID, resource group name, APIM service name, and the ID of the API you wish to delete, respectively. citeturn0search0

**2. Deleting a Product:**

To delete a product within your APIM instance, you can use the following REST API:

```

DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/products/{productId}?api-version=2024-05-01
```


Ensure you replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{serviceName}`, and `{productId}` with the appropriate values.

**3. Deleting a Group:**

To delete a specific group from your APIM service instance, utilize the following REST API:

```

DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}/groups/{groupId}?api-version=2022-08-01
```


Substitute `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{serviceName}`, and `{groupId}` with your specific details. citeturn0search9

**4. Deleting the APIM Service:**

If you're looking to delete the entire API Management service instance, the following REST API can be used:

```

DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{serviceName}?api-version=2024-05-01
```


Again, ensure you replace `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, and `{serviceName}` with your specific details. citeturn0search7

**Important Considerations:**

- **Authentication:** All these REST API calls require proper authentication. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that your requests are authenticated using Azure Active Directory tokens or other supported methods.

- **Dependencies:** Before deleting resources, be aware of any dependencies. For instance, deleting a product will remove all its subscriptions and associated subscription keys. When you recreate the product, you'll need to resubscribe users and distribute new subscription keys. citeturn0search4

- **Irreversibility:** Deletion operations are irreversible. Ensure that you have backups or that the resources are no longer needed before proceeding.

For more detailed information, refer to the official Microsoft documentation on the respective REST APIs.
