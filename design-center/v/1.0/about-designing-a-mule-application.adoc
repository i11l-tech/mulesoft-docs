how and what rest api's to use for reassigning products in apim to subscription or usecase


In Azure API Management (APIM), to reassign products to subscriptions or use cases, you would typically interact with the Azure API Management REST API. Below are the steps and relevant APIs to achieve this.

### 1. **Reassign Products to Subscription**

To reassign or associate a product with a subscription in APIM, you will use the `Add subscription to product` API. This will allow you to associate a product with a specific subscription.

#### API:
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products/{productId}`

##### Description:
This API allows you to associate a subscription with a product. The API call would be used to reassign the subscription to a product, or to include a new product for a specific subscription.

- **Method**: PUT
- **URL**: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apiManagementName}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products/{productId}?api-version={apiVersion}`

##### Example Request:
```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apiManagementName}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products/{productId}?api-version=2021-08-01
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

#### Parameters:
- `subscriptionId`: The unique identifier of the subscription you want to update.
- `resourceGroupName`: The name of the Azure resource group containing the APIM instance.
- `apiManagementName`: The name of your Azure API Management service.
- `productId`: The unique identifier of the product you want to reassign to the subscription.
- `api-version`: The API version to use, such as `2021-08-01`.

#### Response:
A successful call will return a status of 204 No Content, indicating the product has been reassigned to the subscription.

### 2. **Reassign Products to Use Case (API Management Use Case)**

If you need to assign products to different use cases or organize them based on use cases in APIM, the general process is similar to managing products themselves, as there's no explicit "use case" API in APIM. However, this can be handled through product categorization and associating products with different subscriptions, groups, or policies that represent a use case.

You can define a **Product** and associate it with specific **API policies** that target specific use cases. You could also group users in **subscriptions** that represent use cases.

#### Steps:
1. **Create Products**: Define products that represent a use case.
   - Use the `POST /products` API to create new products.
2. **Assign Users/Subscriptions to Products**: Use the `PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products/{productId}` API to associate products with subscriptions that represent a use case.
3. **Apply Policies for Use Case**: Use API policies to apply specific rules for these products.

#### Create Product API:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /products`

##### Example Request:
```http
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apiManagementName}/products?api-version=2021-08-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
    "properties": {
        "displayName": "My API Use Case Product",
        "description": "This product represents a specific use case",
        "isPublished": true
    }
}
```

### 3. **Listing Subscriptions Associated with a Product**

If you want to see which subscriptions are associated with a particular product, you can use the `GET` method on the `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products` endpoint.

#### API:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products`

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{apiManagementName}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/products?api-version=2021-08-01
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### 4. **Considerations**

- Ensure you have appropriate permissions (like `Contributor` or `API Management Service Contributor`) to manage products and subscriptions.
- The APIs above assume you are using the Azure REST API with an authentication token (Bearer token). You may need to authenticate using Azure Active Directory (AAD) OAuth2.
- Make sure to handle rate limiting and API throttling when interacting with Azure APIs.

#### Sample Flow:
1. **Create a product** representing a use case (e.g., `Product for Case 1`).
2. **Assign the product to relevant subscriptions** that are also linked to the use case.
3. **Apply specific policies** (if needed) to manage access and behavior.
