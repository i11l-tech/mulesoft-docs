Letâ€™s iron out the flow for clarity:

The Write Service Receives an Event: This service is responsible for handling incoming commands and generating events.

Writing to the Event Source: The write service records the event in the event store, which is always append-only, meaning there are no delete or update operations.

Publishing to the Event Bus: The write service then publishes a projected event to the event bus. Note that this is a projection of the received event, not the exact event itself.

Listening for Events: The read service, which listens to the event bus, receives the projected event.

Updating the Read Database: The read service processes the projected event and makes the necessary updates in the read database, as this database reflects the final state of the entity.


//

Command Service
The controllers, upon receiving requests, raise a command to the command handler.

Command handlers check the command and call the appropriate API on the event sourcing handler.

The event sourcing handler interacts with the MongoDB event store, saving an event for an aggregate and signaling the event producer to publish an event.

The event producer, an abstraction over the Kafka event bus, is responsible for placing an event in the Kafka stream.

Query Service
The Query Service includes a listener called EventConsumer, thanks to .NET's Worker Services and AddHostedService. It pulls events from a Kafka topic.

Upon receiving an event, the EventConsumer invokes the appropriate handler in the event handler, which then writes data to PostgreSQL.

The query service handles read requests by delegating queries to the QueryDispatcher (similar to the CommandDispatcher in the command service).

The QueryDispatcher invokes the appropriate handler in the query handler, which reads data from PostgreSQL and serves the requested data.
